title: AVL part 2 - What an idiot
---

Well, let's go to the next part, adding some AVL implementation in our BST, for now we just implements the violation checking and rotations just for node addition. For the next part we will talk about the AVL Tree deletion.

First, we will have to record the height of every node by adding a variable in our struct node:

{% highlight c %}
typedef struct node
{
	int value;
	struct node *left, *right;
	int height;
} Node;
{% endhighlight %}

Why do we need to record the height in the individual node rather than counting the height everytime we add node? It's pretty obvious that we just trade up to 8 bytes for performance, and I don't believe that I can make a function to count nodes from a certain node to leaf node efficiently (I thought of using pointer to int and traverse to every single node possible and if the new depth found it will update the int but it's pretty obvious the complexity will just insanely high that I prefer singly linked list than this abomination)

Next is we have to update our addNode and addNodeRecursive function:

{% highlight c %}
void addNode(int _value)
{
	Node *newNode = malloc(sizeof(Node));
	newNode->value = _value;
	newNode->left = NULL;
	newNode->right = NULL;
	newNode->height = 0;

	addNodeRecursive(&head, newNode);
}

void addNodeRecursive(Node **curr, Node *newNode)
{
	if(*curr!=NULL)
	{
		if((*curr)->value>newNode->value)
		{
			addNodeRecursive(&((*curr)->left), newNode);
		}
		else
		{
			addNodeRecursive(&((*curr)->right), newNode);
		}
		int leftHeight = (*curr)->left ? (*curr)->left->height : -1;
		int rightHeight = (*curr)->right ? (*curr)->right->height : -1;
		if(leftHeight!=rightHeight)
		{
			(*curr)->height += 1;
		}
	}
	else
	{
		*curr = newNode;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

I've been thinking about this for hours, and this is my final answer on how to count height properly.

So basically, the leftHeight's value is either the height of current node's left child, or -1 if current node doesn't have left child, because this is recursion, so the height counter starts working after we finished inserting the node, starts from the parent of the new node. Finally now we talk about the exciting part, we compare the height of the left child and the right child, if it's different, then we add 1 to current node's height, this is the idea behind the algorithm: we starts from the parent of the new node, he has new child, we can't say that the height will be added, because what if he already have 1 child (for example the new child is left child, and the old child is right child) so we don't add the height because height is the number of nodes he needs to traverse to visit the most deepest / fartest node, for example the leaf node have height 0 (as the addNode function do, set the new node to 0) because to visit the fartest node possible he does not need to go anywhere, as he's the fartest node. So, we only add the height if there's a difference between the height of left child and right child, if one of them is empty the height is -1, if the parent of the new node only have 1 node, that is the new node, then the leftHeight would be 0 and rightHeight would be -1, there's a difference, so we add the height of the parent by 1. But what would happen if the he already has 1 child, the right child, and we just add new node as his left child? the rightHeight would be 0, and the leftHeight would be 0 too, so we left the height unchanged. It's the same for the grandfather of new node, great-grandfather, great-greatgrandfather, etc.

Just realized I refer the node as 'he', "b-but the node should have freedom to decide xir gender! :("

It's just a height counter, but how we detect the violation?

Now we add 1 function:

{% highlight c %}
void checkViolation(Node **curr)
{
	int bF1 = balanceFactor(*curr);
	if (bF1==0)
	{
		return;
	}
	int bF2 = bF1==1 ? heightCompare((*curr)->left) : heightCompare((*curr)->right);
	if(bF1==1 && bF2==1)
	{
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->left), &((*curr)->left->right));
	}
	else if(bF1==-1 && bF2==-1)
	{
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->right), &((*curr)->right->left));
	}
	else if(bF1==1 && bF2==-1)
	{
		rotateNode(&((*curr)->left), &((*curr)->left->right), &((*curr)->left->right->left));
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->left), &((*curr)->left->right));
	}
	else
	{
		rotateNode(&((*curr)->right), &((*curr)->right->left), &((*curr)->right->left->right));
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->right), &((*curr)->right->left));
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

The function name is kinda unrepresenting the function, let's just leave it be, the violation checking is basically only the first part, the balanceFactor itself is not returning the balanceFactor, instead it returns whether it violates the AVL rule, if it violates AVL then it returns the direction of the violation, the source is here:

{% highlight c %}
int balanceFactor(Node *curr)
{
	int leftHeight = curr->left ? curr->left->height : -1;
	int rightHeight = curr->right ? curr->right->height : -1;
	int bF = leftHeight - rightHeight;
	if(bF>=-1 && bF<=1)
	{
		return 0;
	}
	return bF>0 ? 1 : -1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

It's pretty self-explanatory I think? Just in case you don't understand what is balance factor, the balance factor is the difference between left child's height and right child's height, if it's 2 or more than 2, then it's violate the AVL rule, why is that? Because if the height of the left is 2 and the right's height is 0, then left route is farther than right route by 2 nodes, that's a problem because if we want to make a balanced tree we have to make sure that the one of the farthest node's route is not so different with another farthest node's route. If you understand what's the balance factor, the next is the return value of the balanceFactor, the return value is either -1, 0, or 1, 0 indicates that the subtree is balanced, or the node is not violating the AVL rule, -1 and 1 indicates that the node is violating the AVL rule, -1 indicates that the right route is much farther than the left route, 1 indicates otherwise.

We go back to the checkViolation function, after we know that the node is violating the AVL rule, we have to fix it, by rotating the nodes, the second checking, heightCompare is to make sure we make the right rotation, here's the source:

{% highlight c %}
int heightCompare(Node *curr)
{
	int leftHeight = curr->left ? curr->left->height : -1;
	int rightHeight = curr->right ? curr->right->height : -1;
	if(leftHeight>=rightHeight)
	{
		return 1;
	}
	return -1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Same as the balanceFactor function, the return value is either 1 or -1, 1 indicates the left route is farther than the right route, the -1 indicates otherwise.

Summary: the balanceFactor function return the 1st direction of rotation, and the heightCompare function return the 2nd direction of rotation, the rotation direction is indicated by which route is farthest.

Next is rotateNode:

There are 2 possible direction for 1st and 2nd direction, so there's 4 posible set of directions, left-left, right-right, left-right, right-left. For the left-left and right-right, the rotation would be the node below the violating node is become the parent of the violating node, and the child of the former child node of the violating node become the child of the violating node, for example, the set of directions is left-left, starts from the violating node (node 1), and his left child (node 2), the node 2 moves up to node 1's position, node 1 become the right child of node 2, the former right child of node 2 become left child of node 1. The same applies to the right-right set of direction.

For left-right and right-left, we have to make the direction same, for example, the left-right should become left-left, how to do that? Starts from the violating node (node 1), left child of the violating node (node 2), the right child of node 2 (node 3), node 2 and node 3 switch places, node 3 become the left child of node 1, node 2 become the left child of the node 3, if node 3 formerly have left child, then it became the right child of node 2, and then do the rotation as left-left condition for node 1 and node 2. The same applies to the right-left with some adjustment.

Actually I thought I have to make 2 function, first to rotate (for same direction condition) and the second to switch (different direction condition) but I just realize if you make the function to manipulate their pointers, you don't have to make 2 function as the 2 of them have the same principle, here's the code:

{% highlight c %}
void rotateNode(Node **node1ptr, Node **node2ptr, Node **node2ChildPtr)
{
	Node *node2Child = *node2ChildPtr;
	Node *node1 = *node1ptr;
	Node *node2 = *node2ptr;
	*node1ptr = node2;
	*node2ChildPtr = node1;
	*node2ptr = node2Child;
	fixHeight(node1);
	fixHeight(node2);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let us analyza the conditions in the function calls:

{% highlight c %}
...
	if(bF1==1 && bF2==1)
	{
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->left), &((*curr)->left->right));
	}
	else if(bF1==-1 && bF2==-1)
	{
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->right), &((*curr)->right->left));
	}
	else if(bF1==1 && bF2==-1)
	{
		rotateNode(&((*curr)->left), &((*curr)->left->right), &((*curr)->left->right->left));
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->left), &((*curr)->left->right));
	}
	else
	{
		rotateNode(&((*curr)->right), &((*curr)->right->left), &((*curr)->right->left->right));
		rotateNode(curr, &((*curr)->right), &((*curr)->right->left));
	}
...
{% endhighlight %}

If we analyze the condition for same direction and different direction, the different condition requires us to switch the node first, the node switching is exactly only manipulate 3 pointers, and because it's double pointer, we don't have to care about which direction they switch and which child we have to give to the node, etc, because basically we only switch the pointers around. I can't explain this clearer than you just have to stare the code for like 5 minutes, honestly, I bad at explaining things without people asking.

The last function is fixHeight:

{% highlight c %}
void fixHeight(Node *curr)
{
	int leftHeight = curr->left ? curr->left->height : -1;
	int rightHeight = curr->right ? curr->right->height : -1;
	curr->height = leftHeight>rightHeight ? leftHeight+1 : rightHeight+1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

It basically just fix the height, because obviously when we rotate the position the height will be different.

Lastly, we put the checkViolation function calls, it's right here:

{% highlight c %}
void addNodeRecursive(Node **curr, Node *newNode)
{
	if(*curr!=NULL)
	{
		if((*curr)->value>newNode->value)
		{
			addNodeRecursive(&((*curr)->left), newNode);
		}
		else
		{
			addNodeRecursive(&((*curr)->right), newNode);
		}
		int leftHeight = (*curr)->left ? (*curr)->left->height : -1;
		int rightHeight = (*curr)->right ? (*curr)->right->height : -1;
		if(leftHeight!=rightHeight)
		{
			(*curr)->height += 1;
		}
		checkViolation(curr);
	}
	else
	{
		*curr = newNode;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

I hope this write up actually helps. Until the next round, we will implements the deletion.

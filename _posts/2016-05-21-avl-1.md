title: AVL part 1 - Tasteful BST
---

(This AVL series is just a little documentation on my study for Data Structure, or general C, for now I want to implement AVL Tree in C)

A Tasteful code

In the morning I watched Linus Torvalds in TED, talking about his life, Linux, and he talked about tasteful code, so basically tasteful code is an optimized code, and honestly I think makes the code unreadable and shit, but somehow I understand why, to achieve this optimized code for me, I need solve the problem like million times to get the big pattern, because by nature, you write an optimized code when you understand the problem deeply.

Okay, back to the topic.

I've wrote a Binary Search Tree implementation in C several times before, before I even know how to delete a node properly by searching successor within the subtree and all that crap, because I learnt BST before I even got Data Structure course in college. So yeah, I really familiar with BST, but not with the 'good' BST.

So I wrote everything from scratch, and here's the result

{% highlight c %}
typedef struct node
{
	int value;
	struct node *left, *right;
} Node;
{% endhighlight %}

starts from the node struct
